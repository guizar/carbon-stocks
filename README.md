This project proposes a workflow to process satelite lidar to characterise forests canopy composition. Waveform lidar is used to determine the vertical structure of foliage, which in turn is used to derive stem density, basal area and biomass. Methods and results derived from this project are further developed in [this](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8013090/)  publication.
