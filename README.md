## To-do

## 02../03..R
-  Create elevation differences DF: Needs to be properly documented

### General maintenance 
- Homogenize stated read/write dirs  [data / RData / etc... ]
- check whether write.csv() folders match with present project config
- Free up some .RData space: Write separate datasets for objects that need not to be present at this stage
